%% Matlab image processing introduction
%
% David Young
%
% This is to help you get started with image processing in Matlab.

%% Setup
% You can execute the code in this file a section at a time to see the
% effects. (If you run the whole script, the results will overwrite each
% other.) You can execute a few lines by copying them into the Matlab
% Command Window. Alternatively, you can view the script in the Matlab
% editor, and activate Cell Mode from the Cell menu. Then you can click in
% a cell (a section between two headings) to highlight it and click the
% "Evaluate cell" icon, or press CTRL-ENTER, to execute it.
%
% First you must set your Matlab path to find the Sussex Matlab computer
% vision teaching libraries. This involves executing an |addpath| command.
% Details of what to put in this command depend on which computer you are
% using and are given at the start of the course.
% 
% You will need to execute the |addpath| command at the start of each
% future session. You can do this by copying it to a startup.m file in the
% directory (folder) in which you start up Matlab, or you can just type it
% in, cut and paste it, or use Matlab's history mechanism each time.

%% Read in an image
% This uses the local function |teachimage| to read an image from disc, and
% convert it correctly to a gray-level array with values in the range 0-1.
%
% We then use the Matlab function |imshow| to display it in a figure window.

Image = teachimage('edin_lib.bmp');
imshow(Image);

%% Find out the size of the image
% Print the number of rows and the number of columns. The |size| function
% operates on any matrix, not just ones holding image data.

[rmax, cmax] = size(Image)

%% Simple image processing (conventional version)
% Subtract each pixel from the one on its right, using loops and indexing
% as in ordinary languages.

Diffs = zeros(rmax, cmax-1);    % Pre-allocate array
for row = 1:rmax;               % Loop over rows
    for col = 1:cmax-1;         % Loop over columns
        Diffs(row, col) = Image(row, col+1) - Image(row, col);
    end
end

% display the result
imshow(Diffs, []);    % Note the [] gives automatic grey-level scaling

%% Simple image processing (Matlab version)
% Now the same operation, using Matlab matrix operations, which are very much
% faster and simpler to write. We then print out the largest absolute
% difference to check that the results are the same as before.

Im1 = Image(:, 1:cmax-1);       % Miss off the rightmost column
Im2 = Image(:, 2:cmax);         % Miss off the leftmost column
Diffs2 = Im2 - Im1;             % Subtract pixel values

maximum_difference = max(max(abs(Diffs-Diffs2)))

%% Experimenting yourself
% You can experiment with this demonstration yourself, by downloading this
% html document and using Matlab's |grabcode| function to extract the
% original M-file. You can then edit it to experiment with the code.
%
% This document may be accessible from outside Sussex University, but to
% use functions from the local library you need to be a student or member
% of staff of the University.
