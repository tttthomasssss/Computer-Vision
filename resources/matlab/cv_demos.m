%% Sussex Computer Vision Matlab demonstrations

% David Young

%%
% The Matlab demonstrations listed below are available as part of the
% Computer Vision and Digital Image Processing and Analysis courses.
%
% They are intended to be used interactively in the Matlab environment, by
% examining them in the editor and running them a stage at a time using
% cell mode commands (except for |interp_demo| ). It is important to try
% changing the parameters, and perhaps the code as well, to check that you
% understand what is happening.
%
% Most of the demos call functions from the Sussex library of vision
% functions. You can make your own copy of any of these functions (provided
% you are a member of the University) and modify that code as well.
%
% The links take you to the published web-page versions of the demos. These
% may be useful as an aid to revision, but are definitely second-best: to
% really learn from the demos and understand them you need to experiment
% with them.
%
% The last two demos do not have links and need to be run interactively.
% |ipm_demo| is run in cell mode like the others, whilst |interp_demo| is a
% function which should simply be called from the command line.
