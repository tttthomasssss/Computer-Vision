%% Convolutions in Matlab
%
% David Young
%
% This illustrates the convolution algorithm, as it might be written in
% many languages, and also gives some practical information about how
% convolutions can be carried out in Matlab.
%
%% Setup
% Set up an array and a mask. This assumes that you have the Sussex vision
% library in your Matlab path.
%
% The mask is 3x3, but the methods below
% will work whatever the size and shape of the mask.

im = teachimage('butterflies1.bmp');
imshow(im);
m = [2 1 0; 1 0 -1; 0 -1 -2]    % a diagonal edge detection mask

%% General convolution algorithm
% The standard way to do a convolution in most languages, using
% nested loops.
% This is very slow in Matlab, largely because of array bounds
% checking.
%
% Note that the +nmr +nmc in the index calculation for im are there
% only because the output array starts at (1,1). They would be
% omitted in a language that supported general array bounds.

[nxr, nxc] = size(im);     % nxr: number of im rows, etc.
[nmr, nmc] = size(m);
nyr = nxr - nmr + 1;      % get valid output region
nyc = nxc - nmc + 1;

y1 = zeros(nyr, nyc);      % preallocate output array
tic                       

for yr = 1:nyr            % loop over output elements
    for yc = 1:nyc
        sum = 0;
        for mr = 1:nmr    % loop over mask elements
            for mc = 1:nmc
                sum = sum + im(yr-mr+nmr, yc-mc+nmc) * m(mr, mc);
            end
        end
        y1(yr, yc) = sum;  % store result
    end
end

toc
imshow(y1, []);       % show final result

%% Better code in Matlab
% A better way of doing it in Matlab, but without using a library function.
% This does all the multiplications for each mask element together, adding
% them together a whole array at a time. It's much faster in this language,
% and gives the same results, as you can see from the final line of the
% calculation.
%
% This is the kind of method you might employ with parallel processing
% hardware, if it is available.
% The key to understanding this is to realise that xpart is a shifted
% copy of the original input, which is multiplied by one mask element
% and added in to the output. You need to understand how the : operator
% in Matlab lets you get a subarray.

[nxr, nxc] = size(im);     % nxr: number of im rows, etc.
[nmr, nmc] = size(m);
nyr = nxr - nmr + 1;       % get valid output region
nyc = nxc - nmc + 1;

y2 = zeros(nyr, nyc);      % preallocate output array

tic
for mr = 1:nmr              % loop over mask elements
    for mc = 1:nmc
        xpart = im(nmr-mr+1:nxr-mr+1, nmc-mc+1:nxc-mc+1);
        y2 = y2 + xpart * m(mr, mc);
    end
end
toc

% Compare final result
max_difference = max(max(abs(y2-y1)))

%% Using Matlab's built-in function
% This is the standard Matlab function. Again, it returns the same answer.
% It's faster still. Note that tic and toc probably aren't giving very
% accurate reports now, as the time elapsed is very small, and they measure
% clock time rather than CPU time.

tic
y3 = conv2(im, m, 'valid');           % Mask is SECOND argument
toc

max_difference = max(max(abs(y3-y1)))

%% Using the Sussex convolution function.
% For some masks, convolution can be speeded up further using a property
% known as "generalised separability". The local Sussex function
% |convolve2| (also available from the MathWorks file exchange) exploits
% this to see if it can go faster still. The convolution result is still
% almost the same, though there is a very tiny numerical difference due to
% rounding errors in the computations.
%
% The saving isn't evident on a small 3x3 mask (in fact there's a small
% overhead). To see what this function buys us, we will use a much larger
% mask, where the speedup becomes useful. First we time the built-in
% function, then the local one. For accuracy we now need to use cputime
% rather than tic and toc.

g = fspecial('log', 50, 5);   % biggish Laplacian of Gaussian mask

t = cputime;
y4 = conv2(im, g, 'valid');
t = cputime - t;
disp(['Time for Matlab''s conv2 function: ' num2str(t)]);

t = cputime;
y5 = convolve2(im, g, 'valid');
t = cputime - t;
disp(['Time for Sussex convolve2 function: ' num2str(t)]);

max_difference = max(max(abs(y5-y4)))
imshow(y5, []);     % see the output from either

%% Mask combination
% Finally, this demonstrates the associative property of convolution: that
% is, you can make a mask that combines the effects of two masks, by
% convolving the original two together.
%
% We first do smoothing followed by differencing with our original mask,
% then we combine the two masks and do a single convolution with the
% combined mask, and check that the results are the same. Again, there is a
% very tiny numerical error, but the results are effectively identical.

sm = fspecial('gauss', 13, 2);      % A gaussian smoothing mask

% First, do smoothing followed by the previous edge mask
y1 = convolve2(im, sm, 'valid');     
y2 = convolve2(y1, m, 'valid');     % second mask on output of first

% Changing the order above (to m then sm) will have no effect on the final result
% - try it yourself.

% Now form a combined mask
cm = convolve2(sm, m, 'full');      % Need 'full' to get complete mask
% cm is a combined smoothing and diagonal edge mask.
imshow(cm, [], 'InitialMagnification', 500);  % Look at the combined mask
y3 = convolve2(im, cm, 'valid');     % Combined mask on original image

max_difference = max(max(abs(y3-y2)))
figure; imshow(y3, []);

%% Experimenting yourself
% You can experiment with this demonstration yourself, by downloading this
% html document and using Matlab's |grabcode| function to extract the
% original M-file. You can then edit it to try different ideas.
%
% This document may be accessible from outside Sussex University, but to
% use functions from the local library you need to be a student or member
% of staff of the University.
