%% Demonstration of Hough Transform for straight lines
%
% David Young
% 
%% Read in the chessboard image
% This assumes that the Sussex vision library is in your Matlab path.
%
% The image is read, converted to gray-level and then displayed in a new
% figure.

im = teachimage('chess1.bmp');
f1 = figure; imshow(im);

%% Find edges
% We use the Canny edge detector, from the Matlab Image Processing Toolbox.
% The thresholds (0.1 and 0.2) and the smoothing constant (2) have been
% tweaked by trial and error to work well for this image. Note that the
% smoothing has to remove the high spatial frequency texture in the
% background.
%
% After finding the edges, we display the binary edge map in a new figure.

canny_thresh = [0.1 0.2];
canny_sigma = 2;
e = edge(im, 'canny', canny_thresh, canny_sigma);
figure; imshow(e);

%% Perform the Hough transform
% We call the Matlab toolbox |hough| function to perform the tranform. Use
% the Matlab command |helpwin hough| to get more details, and see the
% lecture slides for more information on the principles behind the process.
%
% In the display of the accumulator array, the *theta* axis runs
% vertically, and the *rho* axis runs horizontally. The two roughly
% horizontal rows of bright dots correspond to the two sets of lines at
% different angles on the chessboard.
%
% The default settings for the bin sizes mean that for this input image,
% there are more bins in the *rho* direction than in the *theta* direction.
% This can easily be changed, but the defaults work well in this case.

[h, theta, rho] = hough(e);
figure; imshow(sqrt(h'), []);

%% Find the peaks in the transform
% We use the toolbox function to locate the peak positions. Again, the
% parameters have been tweaked to suit this specific image. The maximum
% number of peaks to find is 21, and peaks must not be closer together than
% 27 bins in |rho| and 11 bins in |theta|.

maxPeaks = 21;
peakSep = [27 11];
p = houghpeaks(h, maxPeaks, 'Threshold', 0, 'NhoodSize', peakSep);

%% Plot the lines on the image
% We first convert the angles used from degrees to radians (because normal
% Matlab functions use radians - |hough| is peculiar in returning degrees).
% We switch back to the figure containing the original image for drawing.
%
% We then use a loop to plot each line. (It would be possible, but fiddly,
% to vectorise this code.) |line_box| is another local function that just
% returns the coordinates of the points where the line intersects the
% boundaries of the image, to simplify plotting.
%
% The results are good but not perfect - but that's to be expected, given
% that there are many objects and textures in the image.

theta = (pi/180)*theta;  % convert from degrees to radians
figure(f1);           % original image window

[nr, nc] = size(im);
hold on               % plot on top of image
for pr = p'           % pr is assigned each row of p in turn
    r = rho(pr(1));   % look up rho for the current line
    t = theta(pr(2)); % look up theta for the current line
    l = line_box(1, nc, 1, nr, r, t);   % get end points
    if ~isempty(l)
        plot(l([1 3]), l([2,4]), 'r-', 'LineWidth', 1);
    end
end
hold off

%% Experimenting yourself
% You can experiment with this demonstration yourself, by downloading this
% html document and using Matlab's |grabcode| function to extract the
% original M-file. You can then edit it to change the
% parameters or to try, perhaps, the toolbox |houghlines| function.
%
% This document may be accessible from outside Sussex University, but to
% use functions from the local library you need to be a student or member
% of staff of the University.
